## Description

This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses `Express.js` for routing, `MongoDB` for database and the `Mongoose` for object modeling. The seed data is created by using `Insomnia`.

To see how the API works by using Insomnia, see the **walk-through demonstration videos** here:[Click!](https://github.com/HuiPan-Peter/Social-Network-API_HuiPan/tree/main/public/walkthroughVideo%26Screenshot)

#### Starting the Server

After installation :
- To invoke the application, run `npm start`.
- When the server is started, the Mongoose models are synched to the MongoDB database.
- Open MongoDB and connect to the MongoDB URI `mongodb://localhost:27017`. On the list of databases, click on `socialNetworkDB` to check the `thoughts` and `users` documents.
- To create seed data and test the API routes, by using [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download).

#### Testing API Endpoints

You can test the API endpoints using Insomnia or a similar tool.

#### GET Routes

- To retrieve user data, make a GET request to `http://localhost:3001/api/users` for all users.
  
- To retrieve user data by ID, make a GET request to `http://localhost:3001/api/users/{userId}` for a specified user.

- To retrieve thought data, make a GET request to `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts`.
  
- To retrieve thought data by ID, make a GET request to `http://localhost:3001/api/users/{thoughtId}` for a specified thought.

Example: GET `http://localhost:3001/api/users` should return a formatted JSON response containing all user data.

#### POST Routes

- To create a new user, make a POST request to `http://localhost:3001/api/users`.

- To create a new thought, make a POST request to `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts`.

- To add a new friend to a user, make a POST request to `http://localhost:3001/api/users/{userId}/friends/{friendId}`, where `{friendId}` is the ID of an existing user who has been added to another by his/her specified {userId} . 

- To create a reaction to a thought, make a POST request to `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/{thoughtId}/reactions`, where `{thoughtId}` is the ID of an existing thought. 

Example: POST `http://localhost:3001/api/users` should allow you to create a new user by sending the required user data in the request body.
```json
// user data
{
  "username": "lernantino",
  "email": "lernantino@gmail.com"
}
```

#### PUT Routes

- To update user or thought data, make a PUT request to the appropriate route, use `http://localhost:3001/api/users/{userId}` or `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/{thoughtId}`;

Example: PUT `http://localhost:3001/api/users/{userId}` should allow you to update user data by providing the updated data in the request body and the ID of an existing user in place of `{userId}`.

#### DELETE Routes

To delete a user, thought, friend or reaction, make a DELETE request to the appropriate route.
- Delete a user by its `id`: use DELETE `http://localhost:3001/api/user/{userId}`
- Delete a thought by its `id`: use DELETE `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/{thoughtId}`
- Delete a friend from a user's friend list: use DELETE `http://localhost:3001/api/users/{userId}/friends/{friendId}`
- Delete a reaction by the `reactionId`: use DELETE `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/{thoughtId}/reactions/{reactionId}`

Example: DELETE `http://localhost:3001/api/users/{userId}/friends/{friendId}` should delete a user with friendId from the friend list of the user with userId.
